Control flow refers to the order in which your Python code executes and the structures that allow you to direct that flow based on conditions or repeat actions multiple times. 

Understanding how to control program execution is essential for creating dynamic applications that can make decisions, process collections of data, and respond to different scenarios appropriately. 

In this section, you'll learn about conditional statements that execute code based on whether conditions are true or false, loops that allow you to repeat code efficiently, and statements that help you manage the flow within these structures:
