Lambda functions, also known as anonymous functions, are small, unnamed functions defined with the `lambda` keyword. They provide a concise way to create simple functions without the need for a formal function definition using `def`.

## Basic Syntax

The syntax for a lambda function is:

```python
lambda arguments: expression
```

A lambda function can take any number of arguments but can only have one expression. The expression is evaluated and returned when the function is called.

```python
# Regular function definition
def add(x, y):
    return x + y

# Equivalent lambda function
add_lambda = lambda x, y: x + y

# Both functions work the same way
print(add(5, 3))       # Output: 8
print(add_lambda(5, 3))  # Output: 8
```

**Important:**
Lambda functions are limited to a single expression. They cannot contain multiple statements or complex logic that would require multiple lines of code.

## When to Use Lambda Functions

Lambda functions are most useful in situations where:

1. You need a simple function for a short period
2. You want to pass a function as an argument to another function
3. You need to define a function inside another function

Lambda functions are commonly used with higher-order functions like `map()`, `filter()`, and `sorted()`.

## Lambda with `map()`

The `map()` function applies a function to each item in an iterable (like a list).

```python
# Using a regular function with map()
def square(x):
    return x ** 2

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
squared_numbers = list(map(square, numbers))
print(squared_numbers)  # Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]

# Using a lambda function with map()
squared_numbers_lambda = list(map(lambda x: x ** 2, numbers))
print(squared_numbers_lambda)  # Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
```

In this example, the lambda function `lambda x: x ** 2` is applied to each element in the `numbers` list, creating a new list with the squared values.

## Lambda with `filter()`

The `filter()` function creates a new iterable with elements from the original iterable for which a function returns `True`.

```python
# Using a regular function with filter()
def is_even(x):
    return x % 2 == 0

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
even_numbers = list(filter(is_even, numbers))
print(even_numbers)  # Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]

# Using a lambda function with filter()
even_numbers_lambda = list(filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, numbers))
print(even_numbers_lambda)  # Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```

Here, the lambda function `lambda x: x % 2 == 0` tests each element in the `numbers` list and keeps only those that are even.

## Lambda with `sorted()`

The `sorted()` function returns a new sorted list from the elements of any iterable. You can use a lambda function as the `key` parameter to customize the sorting logic.

```python
# List of tuples (name, age)
people = [
    ("Alice", 25),
    ("Bob", 19),
    ("Charlie", 32),
    ("David", 27)
]

# Sort by name (first element in each tuple)
sorted_by_name = sorted(people)
print(sorted_by_name)  # Sorts by the first element by default

# Sort by age (second element in each tuple) using lambda
sorted_by_age = sorted(people, key=lambda person: person[1])
print(sorted_by_age)

# Sort by name length using lambda
sorted_by_name_length = sorted(people, key=lambda person: len(person[0]))
print(sorted_by_name_length)
```

In this example, we're using lambda functions to specify which part of the tuple should be used for sorting.

## Lambda with `reduce()`

The `reduce()` function (from the `functools` module) applies a function of two arguments cumulatively to the items of an iterable, reducing it to a single value.

```python
from functools import reduce

# Calculate the product of all numbers in a list
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Using a regular function
def multiply(x, y):
    return x * y

product = reduce(multiply, numbers)
print(product)  # Output: 120 (1*2*3*4*5)

# Using a lambda function
product_lambda = reduce(lambda x, y: x * y, numbers)
print(product_lambda)  # Output: 120
```

The lambda function `lambda x, y: x * y` takes two arguments and multiplies them together. The `reduce()` function applies this lambda to the first two elements of the list, then to the result and the next element, and so on.

## Multiple Arguments in Lambda Functions

Lambda functions can take multiple arguments:

```python
# Lambda function with two arguments
multiply = lambda x, y: x * y
print(multiply(5, 3))  # Output: 15

# Lambda function with three arguments
calculate = lambda x, y, z: x + y * z
print(calculate(2, 3, 4))  # Output: 14 (2 + 3*4)
```

## Default Arguments in Lambda Functions

Lambda functions can also have default arguments:

```python
# Lambda with a default argument
greet = lambda name, greeting="Hello": f"{greeting}, {name}!"
print(greet("Alice"))          # Output: Hello, Alice!
print(greet("Bob", "Hi"))      # Output: Hi, Bob!
```

## Lambda Functions as Return Values

You can return lambda functions from other functions:

```python
def power_function(n):
    return lambda x: x ** n

square = power_function(2)
cube = power_function(3)
fourth_power = power_function(4)

print(square(5))       # Output: 25 (5^2)
print(cube(5))         # Output: 125 (5^3)
print(fourth_power(5))  # Output: 625 (5^4)
```

In this example, `power_function()` returns a lambda function that raises its argument to the power of `n`. We create three different functions for squaring, cubing, and raising to the fourth power.

## Immediately Invoked Lambda Functions

You can define and call a lambda function in one step:

```python
# Define and call in one step
result = (lambda x, y: x + y)(5, 3)
print(result)  # Output: 8
```

This pattern is less common in Python than in some other languages, but it can be useful in specific situations.

## Lambda Functions with Conditional Expressions

Lambda functions can include conditional expressions:

```python
# Lambda with a conditional expression
is_adult = lambda age: "Adult" if age >= 18 else "Minor"
print(is_adult(20))  # Output: Adult
print(is_adult(15))  # Output: Minor

# More complex conditional
grade = lambda score: "A" if score >= 90 else ("B" if score >= 80 else ("C" if score >= 70 else ("D" if score >= 60 else "F")))
print(grade(95))  # Output: A
print(grade(85))  # Output: B
print(grade(60))  # Output: D
```

**Note:**
While you can include conditional expressions in lambda functions, they should remain simple. If the logic becomes complex, it's better to use a regular function with proper if-else statements for readability.

## Practical Examples of Lambda Functions

### Example 1: Custom Sorting

Sort a list of dictionaries by a specific key:

```python
# List of student dictionaries
students = [
    {"name": "Alice", "grade": 85},
    {"name": "Bob", "grade": 92},
    {"name": "Charlie", "grade": 78},
    {"name": "David", "grade": 87}
]

# Sort by grade (highest to lowest)
sorted_by_grade = sorted(students, key=lambda student: student["grade"], reverse=True)

print("Students sorted by grade (highest to lowest):")
for student in sorted_by_grade:
    print(f"{student['name']}: {student['grade']}")
```

### Example 2: Data Transformation

Transform a list of data:

```python
# List of temperatures in Celsius
celsius_temps = [20, 25, 30, 35, 40]

# Convert to Fahrenheit using map with lambda
fahrenheit_temps = list(map(lambda c: (c * 9/5) + 32, celsius_temps))

print("Celsius temperatures:", celsius_temps)
print("Fahrenheit temperatures:", fahrenheit_temps)
```

### Example 3: Filtering Data Based on Multiple Conditions

Filter items based on complex conditions:

```python
# List of products
products = [
    {"name": "Laptop", "price": 1200, "in_stock": True},
    {"name": "Smartphone", "price": 800, "in_stock": True},
    {"name": "Tablet", "price": 500, "in_stock": False},
    {"name": "Headphones", "price": 150, "in_stock": True},
    {"name": "Monitor", "price": 300, "in_stock": False}
]

# Filter products: in stock and price under 1000
available_affordable = list(filter(
    lambda product: product["in_stock"] and product["price"] < 1000,
    products
))

print("Available and affordable products:")
for product in available_affordable:
    print(f"{product['name']} - ${product['price']}")
```

### Example 4: Creating Function Factories

Create customized functions dynamically:

```python
def price_calculator(tax_rate):
    """Returns a function that calculates the price after tax."""
    return lambda price: price * (1 + tax_rate)

# Create tax calculators for different regions
calculate_price_ca = price_calculator(0.0725)  # 7.25% tax in California
calculate_price_ny = price_calculator(0.0845)  # 8.45% tax in New York

# Test the calculators
product_price = 100.00
print(f"Product base price: ${product_price}")
print(f"Price in California: ${calculate_price_ca(product_price):.2f}")
print(f"Price in New York: ${calculate_price_ny(product_price):.2f}")
```

## Advantages of Lambda Functions

1. **Conciseness**: Lambda functions allow you to write small functions in a compact way.
2. **Readability**: For simple operations, lambdas can make code more readable by keeping the function definition close to where it's used.
3. **Functional Programming**: They facilitate functional programming patterns, working well with functions like `map()`, `filter()`, and `reduce()`.

## Limitations of Lambda Functions

1. **Single Expression Only**: Lambda functions are restricted to a single expression, making them unsuitable for complex logic.
2. **No Docstrings**: You cannot include documentation within lambda functions.
3. **Limited Debugging**: Debugging lambda functions can be more difficult than regular functions.
4. **May Reduce Readability**: For anything beyond simple operations, regular functions with descriptive names are often more clear.

**Important:**
Lambda functions are best used for simple, short operations. For complex logic or functions that will be reused throughout your code, regular function definitions with the `def` keyword are more appropriate.

## Lambda Functions vs. Regular Functions

| Feature | Lambda Functions | Regular Functions |
|---------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Syntax | `lambda args: expression` | `def name(args): body` |
| Named | No (anonymous) | Yes (has a name) |
| Number of expressions | One only | Multiple |
| Docstrings | Not supported | Supported |
| Return statement | Implicit (expression value) | Explicit (using `return`) |
| Complexity | Simple operations | Any complexity |

```python
# Lambda function
addition = lambda x, y: x + y

# Equivalent regular function
def addition(x, y):
    """Add two numbers and return the result."""
    return x + y
```

## Best Practices for Using Lambda Functions

1. **Keep It Simple**: Use lambdas only for simple, one-line functions.
   
   ```python
   # Good
   square = lambda x: x ** 2
   
   # Bad (too complex for a lambda)
   complex_lambda = lambda x: x ** 2 if x > 0 else "negative" if x < 0 else "zero"
   ```

2. **Assign to a Variable When Reused**: If you need to use the same lambda multiple times, assign it to a variable.
   
   ```python
   # Reusable lambda
   is_even = lambda x: x % 2 == 0
   
   numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
   even_numbers = list(filter(is_even, numbers))
   ```

3. **Consider Regular Functions for Clarity**: When a lambda becomes complex or needs documentation, use a regular function.
   
   ```python
   # Better as a regular function
   def calculate_tax(price, tax_rate):
       """Calculate the price after tax."""
       return price * (1 + tax_rate)
   ```

4. **Use with Higher-Order Functions**: Lambdas shine when used with functions like `map()`, `filter()`, `sorted()`, etc.
   
   ```python
   names = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "David"]
   sorted_names = sorted(names, key=lambda name: len(name))
   ```

## Common Mistakes with Lambda Functions

1. **Trying to Include Multiple Statements**:
   
   ```python
   # This will not work
   invalid_lambda = lambda x: print(x); return x * 2
   
   # Use a regular function instead
   def process(x):
       print(x)
       return x * 2
   ```

2. **Making Lambdas Too Complex**:
   
   ```python
   # Too complex for a lambda
   complex_lambda = lambda x: (x ** 2 if x % 2 == 0 else x ** 3) if x >= 0 else -x
   
   # Better as a regular function
   def compute(x):
       if x < 0:
           return -x
       elif x % 2 == 0:
           return x ** 2
       else:
           return x ** 3
   ```

3. **Not Understanding Closure Behavior**:
   
   ```python
   # This creates a common mistake in loops
   functions = []
   for i in range(5):
       functions.append(lambda: i)
   
   # All functions will use the final value of i
   for f in functions:
       print(f())  # Prints 4, 4, 4, 4, 4
   
   # Correct approach using default arguments
   functions = []
   for i in range(5):
       functions.append(lambda i=i: i)
   
   for f in functions:
       print(f())  # Prints 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
   ```

## Exercises

**Exercise 1:** Write a lambda function that takes a string and returns its length. Use this function with `map()` to get the lengths of all strings in a list.

```python
strings = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "date", "elderberry"]
# Your code here
```

**Exercise 2:** Create a lambda function that checks if a number is between 10 and 20 (inclusive). Use this function with `filter()` to get all numbers in that range from a list.

```python
numbers = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30]
# Your code here
```

**Exercise 3:** Write a function that returns a lambda function. The returned lambda should multiply its input by a value specified when creating the function.

```python
# Your function definition here

# Test with:
double = # Create a function that doubles the input
triple = # Create a function that triples the input
print(double(5))  # Should print 10
print(triple(5))  # Should print 15
```

**Exercise 4:** Use a lambda function as the key parameter in `sorted()` to sort a list of tuples representing people (name, age, height) by:
a) Age (youngest to oldest)
b) Height (tallest to shortest)
c) Name length (shortest to longest)

```python
people = [
    ("Alice", 25, 165),
    ("Bob", 19, 180),
    ("Charlie", 32, 175),
    ("David", 27, 190)
]
# Your sorting code here
```

**Hint for Exercise 1:** The lambda function will take a parameter `s` and return `len(s)`. Use this with `map()` to get a list of lengths.

```python
# Exercise 1 partial solution
length_lambda = lambda s: len(s)
lengths = list(map(length_lambda, strings))
```

In the next section, we'll explore modules and packages in Python, which allow you to organize and reuse code effectively.
