When working with files in Python, many things can go wrong: files might not exist, you might not have the necessary permissions, or the disk could be full. Proper error handling ensures your program can respond gracefully to these issues rather than crashing unexpectedly.

## Common File Operation Errors

Before diving into error handling techniques, let's understand the common errors you might encounter when working with files:

1. **`FileNotFoundError`**: Occurs when trying to open a file that doesn't exist
2. **`PermissionError`**: Occurs when you don't have the necessary permissions to access a file
3. **`IsADirectoryError`**: Occurs when you try to open a directory as a file
4. **`FileExistsError`**: Occurs when trying to create a file that already exists (with certain modes)
5. **`IOError`** or **`OSError`**: General errors for input/output operations
6. **`UnicodeDecodeError`**: Occurs when a file can't be decoded with the specified encoding

## Using try-except for Error Handling

The primary mechanism for handling errors in Python is the `try-except` statement. This allows you to "try" a block of code and "catch" specific exceptions if they occur.

### Basic Structure

```python
try:
    # Code that might raise an exception
    file = open("data.txt", "r")
    content = file.read()
    file.close()
except FileNotFoundError:
    # Code to handle the specific exception
    print("Error: The file 'data.txt' was not found.")
```

### Handling Multiple Exception Types

You can catch different types of exceptions and handle them accordingly:

```python
try:
    file = open("data.txt", "r")
    content = file.read()
    file.close()
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("Error: The file does not exist.")
except PermissionError:
    print("Error: You don't have permission to read this file.")
except Exception as e:
    # Catch any other exceptions
    print(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")
```

### The else Clause

You can use an `else` clause that executes only if no exceptions occur:

```python
try:
    file = open("data.txt", "r")
    content = file.read()
    file.close()
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("Error: The file does not exist.")
else:
    # This block executes if no exceptions were raised in the try block
    print(f"File successfully read. Content length: {len(content)} characters")
```

### The finally Clause

The `finally` clause executes regardless of whether an exception occurred:

```python
try:
    file = open("data.txt", "r")
    content = file.read()
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("Error: The file does not exist.")
finally:
    # This block always executes
    try:
        file.close()
    except:
        pass  # In case file wasn't opened successfully
    print("File operation attempt completed.")
```

**Important:**
When using the `finally` clause to close a file, you need to handle the case where the file might not have been successfully opened. This is why using the `with` statement, as explained below, is often a better approach.

## Using with Statement (Context Manager)

The `with` statement provides a cleaner way to handle files, automatically closing them even if an exception occurs:

```python
try:
    with open("data.txt", "r") as file:
        content = file.read()
        # File is automatically closed when the with block ends
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("Error: The file does not exist.")
except PermissionError:
    print("Error: You don't have permission to read this file.")
```

This approach is preferred because:
1. It automatically closes the file, even if an exception occurs
2. It's more concise and readable
3. It reduces the chances of resource leaks

## Practical Example: Robust File Reading

Let's create a function that reads a file's content with comprehensive error handling:

```python
def read_file_safely(file_path, encoding="utf-8"):
    """
    Safely read a file's content with comprehensive error handling.
    
    Args:
        file_path (str): The path to the file to read
        encoding (str): The character encoding to use (default: utf-8)
        
    Returns:
        tuple: (success_flag, content_or_error_message)
    """
    try:
        with open(file_path, "r", encoding=encoding) as file:
            content = file.read()
        return True, content
    except FileNotFoundError:
        return False, f"Error: The file '{file_path}' was not found."
    except PermissionError:
        return False, f"Error: You don't have permission to read '{file_path}'."
    except IsADirectoryError:
        return False, f"Error: '{file_path}' is a directory, not a file."
    except UnicodeDecodeError:
        return False, f"Error: The file '{file_path}' couldn't be decoded with {encoding} encoding."
    except Exception as e:
        return False, f"Error: An unexpected error occurred: {e}"

# Usage example
success, result = read_file_safely("sample.txt")
if success:
    print("File content:")
    print(result)
else:
    print(result)  # Print the error message
```

This function returns a tuple with a success flag and either the file content or an error message, making it easy to handle both successful and failed file operations.

## Practical Example: Robust File Writing

Similarly, here's a function for safely writing to a file:

```python
def write_file_safely(file_path, content, mode="w", encoding="utf-8"):
    """
    Safely write content to a file with comprehensive error handling.
    
    Args:
        file_path (str): The path to the file to write
        content (str): The content to write to the file
        mode (str): The file mode ('w' for write, 'a' for append)
        encoding (str): The character encoding to use (default: utf-8)
        
    Returns:
        tuple: (success_flag, None_or_error_message)
    """
    try:
        with open(file_path, mode, encoding=encoding) as file:
            file.write(content)
        return True, None
    except PermissionError:
        return False, f"Error: You don't have permission to write to '{file_path}'."
    except IsADirectoryError:
        return False, f"Error: '{file_path}' is a directory, not a file."
    except FileNotFoundError:
        # This can occur if intermediate directories don't exist
        return False, f"Error: The directory for '{file_path}' does not exist."
    except Exception as e:
        return False, f"Error: An unexpected error occurred: {e}"

# Usage example
content_to_write = "Hello, World!\nThis is a test file."
success, error = write_file_safely("output/test.txt", content_to_write)

if not success:
    print(error)  # Print the error message
else:
    print(f"Content successfully written to 'output/test.txt'")
```

## Ensuring Directories Exist

A common issue when writing files is that the directory may not exist. Here's a function that creates the directory if needed:

```python
import os

def ensure_directory_exists(directory_path):
    """
    Ensure that a directory exists, creating it if necessary.
    
    Args:
        directory_path (str): The directory path to check/create
        
    Returns:
        tuple: (success_flag, None_or_error_message)
    """
    try:
        if not os.path.exists(directory_path):
            os.makedirs(directory_path)
        return True, None
    except PermissionError:
        return False, f"Error: You don't have permission to create '{directory_path}'."
    except Exception as e:
        return False, f"Error: An unexpected error occurred: {e}"

# Usage with write_file_safely
def write_with_directory_check(file_path, content):
    # Extract the directory path
    directory = os.path.dirname(file_path)
    
    # If there's a directory part, ensure it exists
    if directory:
        dir_success, dir_error = ensure_directory_exists(directory)
        if not dir_success:
            return False, dir_error
    
    # Write the file
    return write_file_safely(file_path, content)

# Example usage
success, error = write_with_directory_check("new_folder/test.txt", "This is a test")
if not success:
    print(error)
else:
    print("File written successfully")
```

## Working with Temporary Files Safely

When you need to work with temporary files, Python's `tempfile` module provides a secure way to do so:

```python
import tempfile
import os

def process_data_in_temp_file(data):
    """Process data in a temporary file that is automatically cleaned up."""
    try:
        # Create a temporary file
        with tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(mode='w+t', delete=False) as temp:
            temp_path = temp.name
            
            # Write data to the temporary file
            temp.write(data)
            temp.flush()  # Ensure all data is written
            
        # Now the file is closed but still exists
        
        # Process the file (e.g., read it back)
        with open(temp_path, 'r') as file:
            processed_data = file.read().upper()  # Example: convert to uppercase
        
        # Clean up by removing the temporary file
        os.unlink(temp_path)
        
        return True, processed_data
    
    except Exception as e:
        # Clean up if possible
        try:
            os.unlink(temp_path)
        except:
            pass
        return False, f"Error processing data: {e}"

# Example usage
success, result = process_data_in_temp_file("This is test data")
if success:
    print(f"Processed data: {result}")
else:
    print(result)  # Print error message
```

## File Locking for Concurrent Access

When multiple processes might access the same file, file locking becomes important. Here's an example using the `fcntl` module (Unix/Linux/Mac) or the `msvcrt` module (Windows):

```python
def append_to_log_with_lock(log_file, message):
    """
    Append a message to a log file with file locking to prevent conflicts.
    
    Args:
        log_file (str): Path to the log file
        message (str): Message to append
        
    Returns:
        bool: True if successful, False otherwise
    """
    import platform
    import time
    
    # Format timestamp
    timestamp = time.strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")
    log_entry = f"[{timestamp}] {message}\n"
    
    try:
        # Open file for appending
        with open(log_file, 'a') as file:
            # Try to acquire a lock before writing
            if platform.system() == 'Windows':
                # Windows locking
                import msvcrt
                msvcrt.locking(file.fileno(), msvcrt.LK_LOCK, len(log_entry))
                file.write(log_entry)
                # Release the lock
                file.seek(0)  # Go to the beginning of the locked region
                msvcrt.locking(file.fileno(), msvcrt.LK_UNLCK, len(log_entry))
            else:
                # Unix-based locking
                import fcntl
                fcntl.flock(file, fcntl.LOCK_EX)  # Exclusive lock
                file.write(log_entry)
                fcntl.flock(file, fcntl.LOCK_UN)  # Release lock
        
        return True
    
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error writing to log: {e}")
        return False

# Example usage
append_to_log_with_lock("application.log", "User logged in")
```

**Note:**
For production applications, consider using established logging solutions like Python's built-in `logging` module, which handles many of these concerns automatically.

## Handling Large Files

When dealing with large files, reading the entire content into memory might not be feasible. Here's how to process a large file line by line:

```python
def process_large_file(file_path, process_line_func):
    """
    Process a large file line by line without loading it entirely into memory.
    
    Args:
        file_path (str): Path to the large file
        process_line_func (callable): Function to process each line
        
    Returns:
        tuple: (success_flag, result_or_error_message)
    """
    try:
        line_count = 0
        with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
            for line_num, line in enumerate(file, 1):
                try:
                    process_line_func(line.strip(), line_num)
                    line_count += 1
                except Exception as e:
                    return False, f"Error processing line {line_num}: {e}"
        
        return True, f"Successfully processed {line_count} lines"
    
    except FileNotFoundError:
        return False, f"Error: The file '{file_path}' was not found."
    except PermissionError:
        return False, f"Error: You don't have permission to read '{file_path}'."
    except Exception as e:
        return False, f"Error: {e}"

# Example usage: Count words in each line
def count_words_in_line(line, line_num):
    words = line.split()
    print(f"Line {line_num}: {len(words)} words")

success, result = process_large_file("large_document.txt", count_words_in_line)
print(result)
```

## Practical Example: Safe CSV Processing

Let's create a more complex example of safely processing a CSV file with error handling at multiple levels:

```python
import csv

def safe_csv_processor(csv_path, output_path=None):
    """
    Safely reads a CSV file, processes the data, and optionally writes results.
    
    Args:
        csv_path (str): Path to the input CSV file
        output_path (str, optional): Path for output CSV with processed data
        
    Returns:
        tuple: (success_flag, result_or_error_message)
    """
    try:
        rows = []
        row_count = 0
        error_count = 0
        
        # Read and process the CSV file
        try:
            with open(csv_path, 'r', newline='') as csv_file:
                reader = csv.reader(csv_file)
                
                # Get the header row
                try:
                    header = next(reader)
                except StopIteration:
                    return False, "Error: CSV file is empty"
                
                # Process each data row
                for row_num, row in enumerate(reader, 2):  # Start at 2 (header is row 1)
                    try:
                        # Skip empty rows
                        if not any(row):
                            continue
                            
                        # Ensure row has the correct number of columns
                        if len(row) != len(header):
                            print(f"Warning: Row {row_num} has {len(row)} columns, expected {len(header)}")
                            row = row[:len(header)]  # Truncate if too long
                            row.extend([''] * (len(header) - len(row)))  # Pad if too short
                        
                        # Process the row (example: capitalize all text fields)
                        processed_row = [str(cell).capitalize() for cell in row]
                        rows.append(processed_row)
                        row_count += 1
                        
                    except Exception as e:
                        error_count += 1
                        print(f"Error processing row {row_num}: {e}")
                        # Continue processing other rows
        
        except csv.Error as e:
            return False, f"CSV parsing error: {e}"
        
        # Write output file if requested
        if output_path:
            try:
                with open(output_path, 'w', newline='') as out_file:
                    writer = csv.writer(out_file)
                    writer.writerow(header)  # Write header
                    writer.writerows(rows)   # Write processed rows
            except Exception as e:
                return False, f"Error writing output file: {e}"
            
            return True, f"Successfully processed {row_count} rows with {error_count} errors. Output written to {output_path}"

# Example usage
success, result = safe_csv_processor("data.csv", "processed_data.csv")
if success:
    print(result)
else:
    print(f"Processing failed: {result}")
```

## Common File Error Handling Patterns

### 1. Checking If a File Exists Before Opening

```python
import os

def read_if_exists(file_path):
    """Read a file only if it exists."""
    if not os.path.isfile(file_path):
        print(f"Warning: '{file_path}' does not exist")
        return None
    
    try:
        with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
            return file.read()
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error reading file: {e}")
        return None
```

### 2. Safe File Deletion

```python
import os

def safe_delete_file(file_path):
    """Safely delete a file if it exists."""
    try:
        if os.path.isfile(file_path):
            os.remove(file_path)
            return True, f"File '{file_path}' deleted successfully"
        else:
            return False, f"File '{file_path}' does not exist"
    except PermissionError:
        return False, f"Permission denied: Cannot delete '{file_path}'"
    except Exception as e:
        return False, f"Error deleting file: {e}"
```

### 3. Creating Backup Before Modifying

```python
import os
import shutil

def modify_with_backup(file_path, modification_func):
    """
    Create a backup of a file before modifying it.
    
    Args:
        file_path (str): The file to modify
        modification_func (callable): A function that takes file content and returns modified content
        
    Returns:
        tuple: (success_flag, result_or_error_message)
    """
    backup_path = file_path + ".bak"
    
    try:
        # Check if file exists
        if not os.path.isfile(file_path):
            return False, f"File '{file_path}' does not exist"
        
        # Create backup
        try:
            shutil.copy2(file_path, backup_path)
        except Exception as e:
            return False, f"Error creating backup: {e}"
        
        # Read the file
        try:
            with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
                content = file.read()
        except Exception as e:
            return False, f"Error reading file: {e}"
        
        # Modify the content
        try:
            modified_content = modification_func(content)
        except Exception as e:
            return False, f"Error in modification function: {e}"
        
        # Write back to the file
        try:
            with open(file_path, 'w') as file:
                file.write(modified_content)
        except Exception as e:
            # Try to restore from backup if write fails
            try:
                shutil.copy2(backup_path, file_path)
            except:
                pass
            return False, f"Error writing to file: {e}"
        
        return True, f"File modified successfully. Backup saved as '{backup_path}'"
    
    except Exception as e:
        return False, f"Unexpected error: {e}"

# Example usage
def uppercase_content(content):
    return content.upper()

success, message = modify_with_backup("example.txt", uppercase_content)
print(message)
```

## Exercises

**Exercise 1:** Write a function called `safe_read_lines` that safely reads lines from a file and returns them as a list. If any error occurs, the function should return an empty list and print an appropriate error message.

**Exercise 2:** Create a function that merges the contents of two files into a third file. Include proper error handling for all file operations. Test your function with both existing and non-existing files.

**Exercise 3:** Write a program that reads a CSV file containing student records (name, course, grade) and calculates the average grade for each course. Handle all possible errors, including missing files, malformed CSV data, and invalid grades.

**Exercise 4:** Create a function that recursively searches a directory for files with a specific extension (e.g., `.txt`) and performs an operation on each one (e.g., counts the number of lines). Handle all possible errors, including permission issues and malformed files.

**Hint for Exercise 1:** Use a try-except block with the `with` statement to safely open and read the file. Handle specific exceptions like `FileNotFoundError` and `PermissionError` separately.

```python
# Exercise 1 solution outline
def safe_read_lines(file_path):
    try:
        with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
            return file.readlines()
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print(f"Error: The file '{file_path}' was not found.")
    except PermissionError:
        print(f"Error: You don't have permission to read '{file_path}'.")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")
    
    return []  # Return empty list on any error
```
